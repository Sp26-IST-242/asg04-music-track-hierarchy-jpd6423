"""
Represents a music album or podcast series, including the years it was active.

Key concepts to implement:
  • Input validation in __init__ (fail-fast with a clear ValueError).
  • Defensive copy on both input and output so external code cannot corrupt
    the internal years list.
  • A *derived* property (debut_year) that computes its value from stored data
    rather than keeping a second field in sync.
